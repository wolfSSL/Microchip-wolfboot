/* Default wolfCrypt devId threaded through wolfPSA's internal wc_*Init()
 * calls. Set it to a registered devId to route every wolfPSA-issued
 * wolfCrypt call through that callback, the integration hook for offload
 * backends such as wolfHSM. Safe to call before psa_crypto_init().
 *
 * Unset, wolfCrypt's own selection applies (wc_CryptoCb_DefaultDevID()).
 * An explicit devId wins over it, INVALID_DEVID included: that one forces
 * local execution. Restore with WOLFPSA_DEVID_DEFAULT, never with a value
 * read back from wolfPSA_GetDefaultDevID(), which resolves the deferred
 * state rather than reporting it and would turn "let wolfCrypt choose"
 * into a hard pin.
 *
 * Covers every algorithm whose wolfCrypt initializer accepts a devId: AES,
 * 3DES, RSA, ECC, Ed25519, Ed448, X25519, X448, ML-DSA, ML-KEM, LMS, XMSS,
 * SHA-1, the SHA-2 and SHA-3 families, SHAKE, HMAC, CMAC, HKDF, PBKDF2 and
 * the RNG. RIPEMD-160, MD5, Ascon and ChaCha20-Poly1305 always run
 * locally, because wolfCrypt exposes no devId for them or ignores the one
 * it accepts. AES key wrap does too for now: wc_AesKeyWrap_ex() falls back
 * to software when the device has no keywrap handler, and a device that
 * took the KEK through WOLF_CRYPTO_CB_AES_SETKEY leaves no key schedule
 * for that fallback to run on.
 *
 * A backend that keeps per-operation state in devCtx must be built with
 * WOLF_CRYPTO_CB_COPY and WOLF_CRYPTO_CB_FREE, or psa_hash_clone()
 * duplicates the handle and psa_hash_abort() never releases it.
 *
 * PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA never offloads: the callback contract has no
 * deterministic flag, so wolfPSA pins that one algorithm to software. On a
 * WOLF_CRYPTO_CB_ONLY_ECC build there is no software to pin to and it
 * reports PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED.
 *
 * Two escapes outside wolfPSA's control: deriving an X25519 public key
 * goes through the keyless wc_CryptoCb_Curve25519MakePub() and so reaches
 * whichever device registered first (keygen, agreement and all of
 * Curve448 are unaffected), and a WOLF_CRYPTO_CB_FIND build consults its
 * find callback regardless of devId.
 *
 * Threading: one atomic, so setting it under concurrent PSA traffic is
 * defined behaviour wherever wolfSSL_Atomic_Int is real; SINGLE_THREADED
 * and WOLFSSL_NO_ATOMICS builds get a plain int and must serialize the
 * setter themselves. Not a barrier: the value is read once per wolfCrypt
 * object, so an operation spanning the change can use one devId for part
 * of its work and another for the rest. It covers this setting only, not
 * wolfCrypt's unsynchronized gCryptoDev[] table, so register and
 * unregister during single-threaded init or teardown.
 *
 * Returns 0, or NOT_COMPILED_IN for a real devId in a library built
 * without WOLF_CRYPTO_CB. Speaks wolfCrypt, not PSA: int devId and
 * error-crypt.h codes, not psa_status_t. */
