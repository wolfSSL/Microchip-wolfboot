 * @file stm32wb_lptim_pwm.h
 * @brief STM32WB LPTIM-based PWM driver configuration.
 *
 * Implements the generic whal_Pwm interface on top of an STM32WB
 * low-power timer (LPTIM). The LPTIM has a single PWM output, so the only
 * valid channel is WHAL_STM32WB_LPTIM_PWM_CHANNEL (0). The waveform is
 * passed to Start as a whal_Pwm_ChannelCfg, which programs it and begins
 * output; Stop halts it. The driver configuration holds the prescaler, clock
 * source, and polling timeout.
 *
 * The LPTIM has no pulse counter, so only continuous output is supported:
 * the waveform's pulseCount must be WHAL_PWM_PULSE_COUNT_CONTINUOUS, and any
 * finite count is rejected with WHAL_ENOTSUP.
 *
 * The board is responsible for enabling the LPTIM kernel clock and
 * selecting its source (LSE/LSI/HSI16/PCLK) via RCC before whal_Pwm_Init
 * is called; this driver only touches LPTIM registers. The period and
 * pulse are counted in ticks of that kernel clock divided by the
 * configured prescaler.
